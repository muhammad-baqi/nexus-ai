# Nexus — Per-Feature Test Cases (source of truth)

> Populated during `/ship-feature`'s Plan step, one heading per feature, in build order. Each
> feature's test file implements exactly the cases listed under its heading — `it(...)` name ↔
> case. Cross-cutting rules (RLS, auth error shape, no info leak) are NOT repeated here — they
> live once in `.claude/docs/qa-checklist.md`. See `.claude/docs/testing.md` for the full
> rhythm.

Format per feature:

```
## <Feature name> (Day N)
- [ ] Case description, specific to this feature's actual behavior
- [ ] Another case — an edge case unique to this feature, not a generic template
```

---

## Worked example — Register / Login (Day 2)
- [ ] Registering with a password under 8 characters shows inline validation before submit, no request sent
- [ ] Registering with an already-used email behaves identically (same "check your email" screen) as a new registration
- [ ] Logging in with a correct email + wrong password shows the generic "Invalid email or password" message
- [ ] Logging in with an unverified account shows the verify-email prompt with a working resend button
- [ ] Resending the verification email twice within 60 seconds is rate-limited with a clear message

## Worked example — Website Bookmarks save flow (Day 5)
- [ ] Pasting a valid URL creates a visible item immediately, before metadata resolves
- [ ] Pasting an unreachable URL still creates the item, shows "metadata unavailable" within ~10s, and offers manual retry
- [ ] Pasting a URL that canonicalizes to an already-saved bookmark shows the non-blocking duplicate prompt
- [ ] Manually retrying a failed metadata fetch re-enqueues exactly one job, not a retry loop

*(Real feature headings get appended below this line as `/ship-feature` runs, in the order
built — delete these two worked examples once the first real feature's cases are recorded, or
leave them as a style reference; either is fine.)*

## Register (Day 2)
- [x] Password under 8 characters shows an inline error, no Supabase call is made
- [x] Password with no digit shows an inline error, no Supabase call is made
- [x] Password with no letter shows an inline error, no Supabase call is made
- [x] Password/confirmation mismatch shows an inline error, no Supabase call is made
- [x] Valid unique email/password calls `signUp` and shows the "check your email" screen, not a logged-in state
- [x] A mocked `user_already_exists` error (the shape Supabase returns locally, where email confirmation is disabled) shows the identical "check your email" screen — no distinguishing signal. With confirmations enabled (staging/prod), Supabase already returns `error: null` for a duplicate, which the plain success case (above) covers.
- [x] A mocked network/server error shows a retry-able error message, not a silent failure
- [x] Password requirement hints are visible before any submit attempt
- [x] The submit button is never left stuck disabled after an error
- [ ] (Playwright `@smoke`) Filling the register form with valid unique data and submitting lands on the check-your-email screen — test written (`e2e/register.spec.ts`), but not yet green: blocked by a Chromium `ERR_SSL_PROTOCOL_ERROR` navigating to a plain-http URL inside the `playwright` container (curl to the same URL from that container works fine, so it's a browser-launch/flag issue, not real network unreachability). Unrelated to this feature's own logic — see PROGRESS.md's Day 2 note.
